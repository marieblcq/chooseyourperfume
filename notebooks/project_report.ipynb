The exponential development of synthesised molecules started no earlier than the mid 19th century, when the technological advancement, although limited, permitted the synthesis of popular and wildly used scents such as vanillin, coumarin, aliphatic aldehydes and hydroxycitronellal‚öóÔ∏è. Later technological discoveries allowed the synthesis of more complex odors like oakmoss, vetiver and patchouli. Nowadays, our limitations have been significantly decreased and the extent of synthesised aroma is endless, as can be noticed in our ***Choose Your Perfume***üå∏ app."

    "The creation of datasets plays a major role in the evolution of computing skills and technology, and the perfume industry benefits a lot from it. Existing datasets play a critical role in this industry. Even though sensory and particularly olfactory processes are still essential, datasets have helped with the modernizing and enhancing of the procedures of perfume creation in several ways. Firstly, regarding perfume formulation, they allow the analysis of ingredient combination because of the understanding of the structures responsible for a certain scent provided in the datasets. Furthermore, these structures help with predicting how a molecule will smell based on its structure, which is significant for synthetis of scents. Secondly, concerning consumer preference, datasets can identify trends based on scents and build personylised recommendations systems, similar to what is done in this project. Lastly, datatsets are organised units which aid brands for marketing and categorising fragance caracter and their position in the market. Overall, it is safe to say that datasets play an essential role in the development of this project due to its part in the perfume industry."
