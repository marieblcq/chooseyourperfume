    "Welcome to ***Choose Your perfume***üå∏, a pythonüêç based interface which does more than just giving great perfume recommendations. Behind this sweet scented facade actually lies detailled chemicalüß™ and programmingüñ•Ô∏è work, carefully thought through by the creators of this project. \n",
    "The perfume industry is heavily connected to chemistry, between understanding the art of blending scents according to their chemical properties and the ability to synthesis molecules according to growing consumer demand. The exponential development of synthesised molecules started no earlier than the mid 19th century, when the technological advancement, although limited, permitted the synthesis of popular and wildly used scents such as vanillin, coumarin, aliphatic aldehydes and hydroxycitronellal‚öóÔ∏è. Later technological discoveries allowed the synthesis of more complex odors like oakmoss, vetiver and patchouli. Nowadays, our limitations have been significantly decreased and the extent of synthesised aroma is endless, as can be noticed in our ***Choose Your Perfume***üå∏ app.\n",
    "Although detailling the chemical process behind the synthesis of scents and blending of fragrances is not the goal‚öΩ of our project, we are able to offer the users of our app an chemical insight on their favored scents by proving the SMILEs and structures of the chosen molecules."
