A python package to help you find your perfect match, Choose your perfume is a true love story accessible to all.

## emojie Package description

Developped in 2025 by EPFL students, Choose Your perfume is a pip-installable python package which offers perfume recommendations based on the chosen preferences. It regroups a surprising variety of scents to ensure the highest level of customer satisfaction. Not only can the client choose his prefered scents, he can also use rate his fondness for each of them, in order to receive the most appropriate recommendations based on his wishes. Furthermore, in addition to the main goal of the package which is giving perfume recommendations, Choose Your Perfume offers an educational description of the molecules the client is looking for, including their names, chemical formulas and lewis drawings, in the hopes of developing in a client an interest for chemistry.

## emoji Installation

As this package is pip-installable, chooseyourperfume can be installed like so:
```python
git clone https://github.com/marieblcq/chooseyourperfume.git
cd chooseyourperfume
pip install .
```
Or via pip and github as well:
```python
pip install git+https://github.com/marieblcq/chooseyourperfume.git
```
To function correctly, several other packages are needed, incuding 

## üî• Usage

```python
from mypackage import main_func

# One line to rule them all
result = main_func(data)
```
The aim of our project is to study the chemistry of perfume!

This usage example shows how to quickly leverage the package's main functionality with just one line of code (or a few lines of code). 
After importing the `main_func` (to be renamed by you), you simply pass in your `data` and get the `result` (this is just an example, your package might have other inputs and outputs). 
Short and sweet, but the real power lies in the detailed documentation.
